The `key` key is used for the key of the route (It will help you with the key prop inside a loop).\r\n  4. The `icon` key is used for the icon of the route on the DefaultNavbar, you have to add a node.\r\n  5. The `collapse` key is used for making a collapsible item on the DefaultNavbar that contains other routes inside (nested routes), you need to pass the nested routes inside an array as a value for the `collapse` key.\r\n  6. The `route` key is used to store the route location which is used for the react router.\r\n  7. The `href` key is used to store the external links location.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// @mui material components\r\nimport Icon from \"@mui/material/Icon\";\r\n\r\nconst pageRoutes = [\r\n  {\r\n    name:
